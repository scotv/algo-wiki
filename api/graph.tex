\section{Graph Algorithm}
We use \cd{T.Graph} in \cd{t.graph.js} to help implementations of some algorithms in \cd{Graph} static object, which has been put in \cd{graph.*.js}.

All the following methods are invoked like \cd{Graph.*}. To create a graph object, use \cd{new T.Graph*()} 
%(see [APIType](APIType#graph)).

\mb{bfs(graph): [ ]}
Gets the vertex visiting array by BFS order.
\mb{dfs(graph): [ ]}
Gets the vertex visiting array by DFS order.
\mb{dijkstra(graph, s: number = 1): [ ]}
Gets the shortest path length of each vertex from initial vertex $s$.
\mb{multiMinimumCut(graph, times: number): number}
Gets the minimum cut number of graph after that times calculations.
\mb{mstPrim(graph, s: number = 1): number}
Gets the total MST cost of weighted graph by Prim algorithm.
\mb{mstKruskal(graph): number}
Gets the total MST cost of weighted graph by Kruskal algorithm.
\mb{mstKruskal(graph, k): number}
Gets the max space of k-clustering by Kruskal algorithm.
\mb{sccKosaraju(graph): [ ]}
Gets the top $10$ large size strong connect component of directed graph, using Kosaraju algorithm.
\mb{topologicalSort(graph): [ ]}
Gets the topological visiting array of this directed graph.
\mb{undirectedConnected(graph): [ ]}
 gets an array indicating connectivity info of undirected graph. this undirected graph is connected iff  \cd{result.length == 1} AND \cd{result[0][1] == Graph.dfs(graph)}.
