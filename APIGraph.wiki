=`Graph`=
We use `T.Graph` in `t.graph.js` to help implementations of some algorithms in `Graph` static object, which has been put in `graph.*.js`.

All the following methods are call by `T.Graph.*`.

==Static==
|| *Call* || *Meaning* ||
|| `multiMinimumCut(graph: T.Graph, times: number): number` || gets the minimum cut number of graph after that times calculations ||
|| `bfs(graph)` || gets the vertex visiting array by `BFS` order ||
|| `dfs(graph)` || gets the vertex visiting array by `DFS` order ||
