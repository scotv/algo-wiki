=`Graph`=
We use `T.Graph` in `t.graph.js` to help implementations of some algorithms in `Graph` static object, which has been put in `graph.*.js`.

All the following methods are call by `T.Graph.*`.

==Static==
|| *Call* || *Meaning* ||
|| `bfs(graph): []` || gets the vertex visiting array by `BFS` order ||
|| `dfs(graph): []` || gets the vertex visiting array by `DFS` order ||
|| `dijkstra(graph, s: number = 1): []` || gets the shortest path length of each vertex from initial vertex s ||
|| `multiMinimumCut(graph, times: number): number` || gets the minimum cut number of graph after that times calculations ||
|| `mstPrim(graph, s: number = 1): number` || gets the total MST cost of weighted graph by Prim algorithm ||
|| `mstKruskal(graph): number` || gets the total MST cost of weighted graph by Kruskal algorithm ||
|| `mstKruskal(graph, k): number` || gets the max space of k-clustering by Kruskal algorithm ||
|| `sccKosaraju(graph): []` || gets the top 10 large size strong connect component of directed graph, using Kosaraju algorithm ||
|| `topologicalSort(graph): []` || gets the topological visiting array of this directed graph ||
|| `undirectedConnected(graph): []` || gets an array indicating connectivity info of undirected graph. this undirected graph is connected iff `result.length == 1 && result[0][1] == Graph.dfs(graph)` ||
