## Math.Vector
The vector is in $n$ dimension.

#### `new Math.Vector(arr)`
Builds new vector by coordinates array.
#### `new Math.Vector(arr1, arr2)`
Builds new vector by coordinates array of two point.
#### `new Math.Vector(Math.Point, Math.Point)`
Builds new vector by two Math.Point.

#### `Math.Vector.norm(vec): number`
Gets the length of the vec.
#### `Math.Vector.dot(v1, v2): number`
Calculates the `dot` result of two vectors.
#### `Math.Vector.cos(v1, v2): number`
Calculates the `cos` result of two vectors.

#### `norm(): number`
Gets the length of the vec itself.
#### `dot(that): number`
Calculates the `dot` result of this and that.
#### `cos(that): number`
Calculates the `cos` result of this and that.
