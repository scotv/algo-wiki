This book has been migrated from previous wiki page of [algo-js](https://github.com/scotv/algo-js). Lots of namespaces are still in JaveScript, that I am converting right now.

An initial PDF document writed in $\LaTeX{}$ has been released on [Releases](https://github.com/scotv/algo-wiki/releases) page.

The purpose of this book is listing the API of projects algo-x:

*  [algo-js](https://github.com/scotv/algo-js): Implementation of some algorithms using JavaScript
*  [algo-scala](https://github.com/scotv/algo-scala): Implementation of some algorithms using Scala
*  ...
